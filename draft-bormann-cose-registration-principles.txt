                    COSE: On Registration Principles
           draft-bormann-cose-registration-principles-latest

Abstract

   COSE (STD 96, RFC 9052 and RFC 9338) defines a number of registries
   that allow registrants to exercise the numerous extension points
   defined in COSE.  Section 11.6 of RFC 9052 gives the Designated
   Experts for these registries considerable leeway in deciding about
   registration requests.

   The present document is intended to collect information that has been
   the basis for initial population of and further registration in these
   registries.  It is intended to be shaped by the Designated Experts
   and serve them as a collective memorandum and a checklist.  As a
   secondary function, it is also intended to help registrants create
   registrations that are acceptable to the Designated Experts.


   // Revision -00 of this draft is an early skeleton that should allow
   // us to decide whether such a collection of information is useful
   // and whether we want to flesh out this document.

1.  Introduction

   COSE (STD 96, RFC 9052 and RFC 9338) defines a number of registries
   that allow registrants to exercise the numerous extension points
   defined in COSE.  Section 11.6 of RFC 9052 gives the Designated
   Experts for these registries considerable leeway in deciding about
   registration requests.

   Specifically, Section 11.6 of [RFC9052] says:

   |  11.6.  Expert Review Instructions
   |  
   |  All of the IANA registries established by [RFC8152] are, at least
   |  in part, defined as Expert Review [RFC8126].  This section gives
   |  some general guidelines for what the experts should be looking
   |  for, but they are being designated as experts for a reason, so
   |  they should be given substantial latitude.

   ([RFC8152] is the previous edition of what is now RFC9052 and
   [RFC9053]; this document established the registries being discussed,
   which together make up the [IANA.cose] registry group.)

   The further text of Section 11.6 of [RFC9052] gives instructions
   about the general operations of the registries, but does not discuss
   the architectural and structural principles that might go into a
   registration decision.

   The present document is intended to collect information that has been
   the basis for initial population of and further registration in these
   registries.  It is intended to be shaped by the Designated Experts
   and serve them as a collective memorandum and a checklist.  As a
   secondary function, it is also intended to help registrants create
   registrations that are acceptable to the Designated Experts.


   // Revision -00 of this draft is an early skeleton that should allow
   // us to decide whether such a collection of information is useful
   // and whether we want to flesh out this document.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The definitions of [STD94] and [STD96] apply.

2.  COSE Registration Principles


   // This section is a skeleton and needs to be fleshed out.

   At the time of writing, some 172 registrations have been made in the
   COSE registry group [IANA.cose].  These can serve as a body of
   examples how to make registrations.  Unfortunately, not all
   registrations in this set demonstrate outstanding consistency in
   decision making, so this section will collect information about where
   existing registration decisions turned out to be suboptimal or at
   least different in structure than registrations of a similar nature.

2.1.  General Considerations

   Code Point Frugality:  COSE is designed to work in environments where
      at least some of the devices have limited resources; curation of
      codepoints so that the ones that are most frequently used with
      such constrained devices receive the codepoints with the shortest
      representation (and can continue to do so over a number of
      decades) is always an objective.

2.2.  COSE Header Parameters

   ...

2.3.  COSE Header Algorithm Parameters

   ...

2.4.  COSE Algorithms

   Algorithm identifiers in these registrations have a _Recommended_
   Tag, which indicates (Section 16.4 of [RFC8152]):

   |  Recommended:  Does the IETF have a consensus recommendation to use
   |     the algorithm?  The legal values are 'Yes', 'No', and
   |     'Deprecated'.

   Note that an algorithm can be _deprecated_ already at registration
   time.  This value was used in the registration of the
   [I-D.ietf-cose-aes-ctr-and-cbc] values which only can be used under
   very specific conditions.

   Algorithm identifiers are usually assigned so that a single
   identifier stands for a collection of underlying algorithms, with
   main parameters such as key or hash length chosen, so that a single
   algorithm identifier suffices to fully characterize the cryptographic
   operations.  A key is the obvious exception, but also parameters that
   go with a key such as its curve type.

   Where a certain underlying algorithm has a small number of possible
   parameter sets, all registrations for the use of that underlying
   algorithm in a COSE Algorithm are made at the same time.  For
   instance: A128GCM (AES-GCM mode w/ 128-bit key, 128-bit tag) we
   registered together with A192GCM (AES-GCM mode w/ 192-bit key,
   128-bit tag) and A256GCM (AES-GCM mode w/ 256-bit key, 128-bit tag).
   The expert (in this case the author of [RFC9053]) did not make
   separate assessments how useful or desirable the individual parameter
   sets were going to be, but registered them all at once.  When the
   collection of AES-CCM-16-64-128, AES-CCM-16-64-256, AES-CCM-
   64-64-128, and AES-CCM-64-64-256, as well as AES-CCM-16-128-128, AES-
   CCM-16-128-256, AES-CCM-64-128-128, and AES-CCM-64-128-256 were
   registered, these were also registered all at once, but grouped into
   two groups with different representation sizes of the algorithm
   identifier.

2.5.  COSE Key Common Parameters

   ...

2.6.  COSE Key Type Parameters

   ...

2.7.  COSE Key Types

   ...

2.8.  COSE Elliptic Curves

   This registry is governed by similar principles as the COSE
   Algorithms registry (Section 2.4).  Curve types identify all
   parameters of a curve and are registered all at once where natural
   groups of such types exist.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document is about registrations in registries that have direct
   security impact; security considerations that require discussion
   beyond that are mentioned in the discussions above.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
